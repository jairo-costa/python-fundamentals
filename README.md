# 🐍 Python Fundamentals

A clean, structured repository dedicated to Python foundations, essential for Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and GenAI development.

This project documents my progress as I build strong programming fundamentals, focusing on clarity, readability, and practical exercises aligned with real-world AI workflows.

## 📈 Machine Learning Notebooks

### 1. Basic Linear Regression – Synthetic Data

- **Notebook:** `notebooks/day1-basic-ml.ipynb`
- **Descrição:** Primeiro pipeline completo de Machine Learning:
  - Geração de dados sintéticos com `make_regression`
  - Divisão em treino e teste
  - Treinamento de um modelo de `LinearRegression`
  - Avaliação com MSE e R²
  - Visualização de valores reais vs. preditos

    ## Notebooks

1. `day1-basic-ml.ipynb` – First end-to-end ML pipeline (linear regression).
2. `day2-classification-basics.ipynb` – Logistic Regression for binary classification
   with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and decision boundary visualization.


> Resultado: modelo com excelente ajuste, demonstrando entendimento do fluxo de ML de ponta a ponta.
